This package depends on the following libraries.  Apache Commons Codec is used for base64 encoding,
and the JSON library is used for JSON decoding.

- Apache Commons Codec | http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-codec/download_codec.cgi
- JSON                 | https://stleary.github.io/JSON-java/

The makefile included should make this easier to compile and run tests from the command line after
downloading and locating these packages.
